New challenge...

Getting started, I check some info on https://wordpress.com/nl/

- [x] register
- [x]  "start your website"
- [x] free option domain name for your website: deliciousrecepies587404528 (start with a free site)

=> I have my first site :-)  https://wordpress.com/page/deliciousrecepies587404528.wordpress.com/43


I don't think this is very user-friendly
I have to read more to understand all this...

## pages created
 - contact file
 - some info and foto's


But how do I connect them al? I connected a button with a recipe page, but I don't understand how to fix the homepage?

You have to pay for a lot of tools...
